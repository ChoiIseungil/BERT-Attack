abstract = {We present a new large-scale collection of 54,772 queries with manually annotated spelling corrections. For 9,170 of the queries (16.74%), spelling variants that are different to the original query are proposed. With its size, our new corpus is an order of magnitude larger than other publicly available query spelling corpora. In addition to releasing the new large-scale corpus, we also provide an implementation of the winner of the Microsoft Speller Challenge from~2011 and compare it on the different publicly available corpora to spelling corrections mined from Google and Bing. This way, we also shed some light on the spelling correction performance of state-of-the-art commercial search systems.},

@article{HateXplain, title={HateXplain: A Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Hate Speech Detection}, volume={35}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17745}, abstractNote={Hate speech is a challenging issue plaguing the online social media. While better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities. We have made our code and dataset public for other researchers.}, number={17}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Mathew, Binny and Saha, Punyajoy and Yimam, Seid Muhie and Biemann, Chris and Goyal, Pawan and Mukherjee, Animesh}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={14867-14875} }
